# Copy this file to .env and fill the values.

# Option A: Use SendGrid SMTP (recommended for production)
# Create an API key in SendGrid and paste it here
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Option B: Use Gmail SMTP
# If your Gmail account uses 2FA, generate an App Password and use it as EMAIL_PASS
# Use EMAIL_USER as the email address
EMAIL_USER=your@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password

# Common optional variables
EMAIL_FROM="Your Company <no-reply@yourdomain.com>"

# Example recipient for quick tests (optional)
TEST_EMAIL_RECIPIENT=your-test@domain.com

# Note:
# - If SENDGRID_API_KEY is set, the mailer will use SendGrid SMTP (user: 'apikey').
# - Otherwise, EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS must be set (Gmail app password recommended).
# After setting .env, restart the server to pick up environment variables.
